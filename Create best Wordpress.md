Create a WordPress template/theme from an existing website
 (https://freelancer.com/projects/wordpress/create-wordpress-template-theme-from.html)I like how Hurricane Electric's website (he.net (http://he.net/)) looks and feels. Very functional and simple.

I would like a version implemented in WordPress. You don't have to copy it 1-to-1, just have the general layout and feeling.

I am specifically after the Home page, "Get Quote" page (will be used as a contact form), "About Us" and, and "Contact Us".

To create a WordPress theme based on the design of Hurricane Electric's website, you can follow these steps:

1.  **Analysis**:
- Visit the Hurricane Electric website (http://he.net) and thoroughly analyze the layout, structure, and design elements.
- Note down the key components, such as the header, navigation, content sections, footer, etc.
- Pay attention to the color scheme, typography, and overall visual style.

2.  **Set up a development environment**:
- Install WordPress on your local machine or a development server.
- Set up a blank WordPress installation with a default theme as a starting point.  

3.  **Create a child theme**:
- It's best practice to create a child theme to ensure that your changes won't be lost when updating the parent theme.
- Create a new folder in the "themes" directory of your WordPress installation and name it something like "he-child".
- In the child theme folder, create a stylesheet file (style.css).
- In the stylesheet file, add the necessary metadata, such as the theme name, author, etc. Also, specify the parent theme as the default WordPress theme you chose.

4.  **Copy HTML structure**:
- Start by replicating the basic HTML structure of Hurricane Electric's website in the respective template files within your child theme folder.
- Create files like header.php, footer.php, index.php, page.php, and other necessary template files.
- Copy the relevant HTML sections from the original website into their respective template files.

5.**Enqueue styles and scripts**:
- In the child theme's functions.php file, enqueue the CSS and JavaScript files required for the theme.
- You can either copy the CSS from the original website's stylesheets or create your own styles to match the design.
- Include the necessary styles and scripts using WordPress' enqueue functions.

6.  **Customize the header and navigation**:
- Modify the header.php file to match the header and navigation layout of the original website.
- Replace the logo, navigation links, and any other header elements with the corresponding elements from Hurricane Electric's website.

7.  **Implement content sections**:
- Modify the template files (e.g., index.php, page.php) to include the content sections from Hurricane Electric's website.
- Use WordPress functions and the Loop to fetch and display the dynamic content from posts and pages.
- Customize the content sections as per the original website's design.

8.  **Create the "Get Quote" page**:
- Create a new page in WordPress and use it as a contact form, similar to the "Get Quote" page on the original website.
- You can use a WordPress form plugin or create a custom form using HTML and PHP.
- Design and style the form to match the original website.

9.  **About Us and Contact Us pages**:
- Create separate pages for "About Us" and "Contact Us" in WordPress.
- Add the relevant content and design elements from the original website to these pages.
- Customize the page templates to ensure the layout and design are consistent.

10. **Test and refine**:
- Preview your WordPress website and navigate through different pages to ensure everything is working as expected.
- Make adjustments and refinements to the design, layout, and functionality as needed.
- Test the contact form and verify that submissions are received correctly.

11. **Launch and deploy**:
- Once you are satisfied with the WordPress theme and have thoroughly tested it, you can deploy it to your live WordPress site.
- Upload the child theme folder to your WordPress installation's "themes" directory.
- Activate the child theme from the WordPress admin panel.

Remember that while you can replicate the general layout and feeling of Hurricane Electric
